						<h2>History</h2>
						<p>Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.</p>
						<p>Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.</p>
						<p>Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL, capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Its implementation began in December 1989. Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's Benevolent Dictator For Life, a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker. In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a 5-member "Steering Council" to lead the project. As of 2021, the current members of this council are Barry Warsaw, Brett Cannon, Carol Willing, Thomas Wouters, and Pablo Galindo Salgado.</p>
						<p>Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector and support for Unicode.</p>
						<p>Python 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008. It was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible. Many of its major features were backported to Python 2.6.x and 2.7.x version series. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates (at least partially) the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.</p>
						<p>Python 2.7's end-of-life date was initially set at 2015 then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.No more security patches or other improvements will be released for it. With Python 2's end-of-life, only Python 3.6.x and later are supported.</p>
						<p>Python 3.9.2 and 3.8.8 were expedited as all versions of Python (including 2.7) had security issues, leading to possible remote code execution and web cache poisoning.</p>

								<h3>Requests</h3>
								<p>Requests is a part of a much larger collection of libraries by Kenneth Reitz, designed to make things simpler for humans, with things in our case referring to HTTP requests for Python. Being an HTTP library, requests aims to simplify the task of creating and sending HTTP requests to your Python applications.</p>
							</li>
							<li class="library-item">
								<h3>Pandas</h3>
								<p>Similar to NumPy, Pandas is another popular high-performance Python library that is being widely used today for solving modern Data Science and Machine Learning problems. By offering developers access to flexible yet extremely responsive data structures for working with time series and structured data along with the stack of other vital features, Pandas aims to become the best data analysis tool available for solving real-world problems.</p>

								<h3>Numpy</h3>
								<p>NumPy is one of the most used libraries for tasks involving modern scientific computations and evolving yet powerful domains like Data Science and Machine Learning.</p>
